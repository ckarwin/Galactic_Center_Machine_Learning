# Simulation Results
### The directories contain all the main files (input and output) for Sim A and Sim B: <br />
Sim A: Simulate modified; fit modified.<br />
Sim B: Simulate odified; fit standard CO12.<br />

### Also included in the directories are the scripts to run the gamma-ray simulations:<br />
run_fermipy.py: main script<br />
config.yaml: contains all the parameters

### Lastly, there are a few scripts to analyze the results:<br />
analyze_TS.py: plot the pixel distribution versus chi_squared/2
make_residuals.py: calculate the fractional residuals and the spatial residuals
